# CRYPTTO

WHAT?

We are creating a world-class crypto trading platform that combines access to sophisticated proprietary signals and strategies with ultra-fast execution across all major exchanges.

Our strategies and algorithms are based on 3 major signal sources:
Sentiment analysis of ”timed” (news, press-releases, etc.) and live (Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, Bitcointalk, etc.) data
Market data analysis (exchange-specific and aggregated)
Crypto-specific data (on-chain transactions, «whale-watching», wallets activity, etc.)
Our research is extensively based on rigorous statistical analysis, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technics combined with the proprietary coding algorithms. All our signals and strategies are extensively back-tested and out-of-sample validated, with results readily available to platform users.

CRYPTTO trading platform will have 3 levels.
Basic level will have visual signals and manual execution and the most advanced level will provide fully automated trading strategies ("black box").
